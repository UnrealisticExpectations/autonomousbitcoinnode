Bitcoin empowers people all around the world however in many places Internet broadband access is limited or even non existent which makes it complicated to use the Bitcoin network.

The goal of this project is to design an autonomous Bitcoin node built for outdoor places (eg: in a forest, desert, etc) which would provide an easy way to deploy them in remote locations.

The prototype will be built with off the shelves components that are widely available and will use only open source free software. The process will be entirely documented to allow anyone to easily setup their own nodes with the goal to produce an easy to follow guide published on Github.

The node would be built around the Blockstream satellite base station which we already purchased and a Raspberry Pi. We also have access to a small space in a forest with a direct line of sight to the Blockstream satellite. We also have access to a 3D printer to 3D print all required components.

Primary Goals:

    Setup the Blockstream Antenna and Raspberry Pi.
    Use a standard waterproof case to store all the components inside.
    Enable the node to become a Wifi relay and to have local services such as a cloud storage for the local community.
    Create a guide documenting the process to allow to easily recreate it anywhere in the world.

Secondary Goals:

    Use solar panels and batteries to make it fully autonomous.
    Find a way to reduce the initial block download lowering the amount of bandwidth needed for the initial synchronization.
    Experiment with the Freifunk mesh networks to extend the range of the Wifi relay and allowing anyone around it to setup their own nodes.
    Add a way to easily monitor the state of the node.
